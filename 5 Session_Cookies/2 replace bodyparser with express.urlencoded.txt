when dealing with post method we use bodyparser.urlencoded and bodyparser.json method so is it replace by express.urlencoded and express.json() ? 

Yes, exactly. In more recent versions of Express (4.16.0 and later), the `express.urlencoded()` and `express.json()` methods have been introduced, and they are recommended over using `body-parser` directly for these specific functionalities.

Here's how you would typically use them:

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

// Parse URL-encoded bodies (for form data)
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Example route that handles both form data and JSON data
app.post('/example', (req, res) => {
  // Access form data
  const formData = req.body.formField;

  // Access JSON data
  const jsonData = req.body.jsonField;

  // Log the data for demonstration purposes
  console.log('Form Data:', formData);
  console.log('JSON Data:', jsonData);

  res.send('Data received successfully');
});

// ... rest of your Express app

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

As you can see, `express.urlencoded()` and `express.json()` essentially provide the same functionality as `body-parser`'s `urlencoded` and `json` middleware, respectively. Using these methods from the `express` module directly is considered more idiomatic and is the recommended approach in the latest versions of Express. It simplifies the process and makes the code more concise.

bodyParser.urlencoded() returns middleware that parses incoming URL-encoded data in the request body and makes it accessible in the req.body object in your Express routes. Note that, in more recent versions of Express, it's recommended to use express.urlencoded() instead of body-parser.

bodyParser.json() returns middleware that parses incoming JSON data in the request body and makes it accessible in the req.body object in your Express routes. Note that, in more recent versions of Express, it's recommended to use express.json() instead of body-parser.
